# About

- **WordTuts Data Editor**: Edited to add game vocabulary
- **WordTuts**: The game

# How To Play
To play the game, see the word that appears, type the word in the box. When the correct word is typed, press Enter. If the words you enter match, your score will increase by 10. If the words you entered are not correct, your score will decrease by 5. You are required to answer 10 words correctly in the specified time and decrease. If you have reached 10 or more correct words, you will enter the next level. The higher the level you play, the faster the given time will run. This game ends up to level 12.
